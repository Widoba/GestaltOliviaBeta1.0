# Prompt Tuning Implementation

## Implementation Summary

The Prompt Tuning implementation provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing the system prompts used in the Unified Assistant Prototype. This system enables systematic testing, evaluation, and improvement of prompts to enhance:

1. **Intent Classification**: More accurate detection of user intent
2. **Assistant Switching**: Better determination of which assistant should handle a query
3. **Transition Handling**: Smoother transitions between assistants
4. **Context Preservation**: Improved context retention during conversations

## Components

This implementation consists of the following components:

### 1. Testing Framework

- Defined in `/src/utils/promptTesting/promptTestingFramework.ts`
- Provides core functionality for testing prompts against standardized cases
- Calculates performance metrics and compares prompt variations

### 2. Test Cases

- Defined in `/src/utils/promptTesting/testCases.ts`
- Collection of standardized test cases organized by category
- Each test case includes query, expected intent, and expected assistant type

### 3. Prompt Variation Manager

- Defined in `/src/services/promptTuning/promptVariationManager.ts`
- Manages different versions of system prompts
- Includes initial variations focusing on specific improvements

### 4. Prompt Tuning Service

- Defined in `/src/services/promptTuning/promptTuningService.ts`
- Core service for running tests and analyzing results
- Creates optimized prompts by combining the best aspects of different variations

### 5. CLI Tool

- Defined in `/src/scripts/tunePrompts.ts`
- Command-line interface for running tests, comparing variations, and generating optimized prompts
- Accessible via npm scripts in package.json

## Prompt Variations

The implementation includes three initial prompt variations, each focusing on a specific aspect of improvement:

1. **Enhanced Intent Classification**:
   - Improved rules for determining user intent
   - Better handling of ambiguous queries
   - More precise criteria for confidence scoring

2. **Improved Transition Handling**:
   - More natural transition phrases
   - Refined rules for when to switch assistants
   - Better continuity during transitions

3. **Optimized Context Preservation**:
   - Enhanced entity tracking across conversations
   - Improved context memory during assistant switches
   - Better handling of follow-up queries

## Optimization Process

The system can automatically create an optimized prompt that combines the best aspects of each variation:

1. Run tests for all variations to gather performance metrics
2. Identify the best-performing variation for each metric
3. Extract the relevant sections from each best variation
4. Combine them into a unified optimized prompt
5. Test the optimized prompt to verify performance improvements

## Usage

To use the prompt tuning system:

```bash
# View all available prompt variations
npm run tune-prompts:list

# Run tests on all variations and create an optimized prompt
npm run tune-prompts:all

# Create and test an optimized prompt
npm run tune-prompts:optimize
```

For more detailed usage, see the README in the testing framework directory.

## Integration with Application

The prompt tuning system is designed to produce optimized prompts that can be directly integrated into the application:

1. Run the optimization process to generate an optimized prompt
2. Review the generated prompt for coherence and quality
3. Update the appropriate prompt file in `/src/prompts/`
4. Deploy the updated prompt to production

## Next Steps

After prompt tuning, the next steps in the development process will be:

1. **Performance Optimization** (Phase 4, Step 2)
2. **User Flow Testing** (Phase 4, Step 3)

The prompt tuning system provides a foundation for ongoing prompt optimization as the application evolves.
